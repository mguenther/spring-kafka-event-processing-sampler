# Spring Kafka for Event Processing

This repository contains a simple solution that demonstrates the integration of Kafka into a Spring Boot application using Spring Kafka, while leveraging Apache Avro as serialization framework for encoding events that are persisted to a Kafka log. The code presented in this repository is the joint work of [Boris Fresow](mailto://bfresow@gmail.com) and [Markus GÃ¼nther](mailto://markus.guenther@gmail.com) as part of an article series on **Building Event-based applications with Spring Kafka** for the German [JavaMagazin](https://jaxenter.de/magazine/java-magazin).
